# Warnet Dev

These scripts are primarily for my own use, but can be adapted for 
setting up test lightning networks using [warnet](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet).

## Once-Off installation

- `source ./new_term.sh`
- Follow [warnet's installation instructions](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet/blob/main/docs/install.md#install-warnet).
  - You do not need to create a custom network when you `warnet init`.

## Regular Usage

You *must always* `source ./new_term.sh` to use the shortcuts set up in this repo!

You can do this by:
- Running `source ./new_term.sh` in every new terminal window.
- Using [warnet.yml](warnet.yml) tmuxinator template.

## Shortcuts



❤️ and credit goes to @guggero who created a similar setup for internal use at LL!
This is entirely inspired by that setup, and I am so grateful for the incredible use I got out of it.
