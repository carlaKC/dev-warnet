## Warnet Dev

These scripts are primarily for my own use, but can be adapted for 
setting up test lightning networks using [warnet](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet).

- `*.graphml`: various topologies to test against 
  - Can be used independently following warnet's instructions
- `warnet.yml`: tmuxinator template for a warnet session
  - NB: contains path to my local clone to this repo, replace with yours
